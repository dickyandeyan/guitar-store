			"description": "Inspired by Peter Frampton's Legendary 1954 Les Paul Custom, The \"Phenix\" Les Paul Custom is the iconic guitar that is heard on, and that graced the cover of 1976's classic \"Frampton Comes Alive!\" LP. Thought to have been lost in 1980 in a tragic cargo plane crash, it miraculously survived, and over thirty years later, it was returned to Peter, and thus earned its Phenix nickname. Now the Gibson Custom Shop is proud to offer a VOS rendition of this guitar as an Artist model. It has all of the classic Les Paul Custom cosmetic appointments, along with a weight-relieved mahogany body with a solid mahogany top, gold hardware, Grover® tuners, Schaller Strap Locks, and three open-coil Custombucker humbuckers™. The VOS finish gives it the look of a vintage original, minus the dings and scars that the original Phenix now bears. It also features custom wiring. The 3-way toggle switch controls the neck and bridge pickups, just as on a two-pickup Les Paul Custom, and they share a volume and tone control. The second set of volume and tone controls are connected to the middle pickup; it can be used with either (or both) of the other two pickups. It can even be used by itself when the other pickups are turned down, making this Phenix-inspired model not only an iconic looking and great sounding guitar, but a highly flexible one as well. ",
