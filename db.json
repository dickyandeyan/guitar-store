			"description": "A Classic Reborn, The new Les Paul Standard returns to the classic design that made it relevant, played and loved -- shaping sound across generations and genres of music. It pays tribute to Gibson's Golden Era of innovation and brings authenticity back to life. The Les Paul Standard 50's has a solid mahogany body with a maple top, a rounded 50's-style mahogany neck with a rosewood fingerboard and trapezoid inlays. It's equipped with an ABR-1, the classic-style Tune-O-Matic bridge, aluminum stop bar tailpiece, vintage deluxe tuners with keystone buttons, and aged gold tophat knobs. The calibrated Burstbucker 1 (neck) and Burstbucker 2 (bridge) pickups are loaded with AlNiCo II magnets, audio taper potentiometers and orange drop capacitors.",

			"description": "A 70s Classic Returns, First released in 1969, the Deluxe saw the introduction of the mini humbucker™ to the Les Paul lineup. Mini humbuckers retain the hum-free performance of their full-sized cousins but with a somewhat clearer and brighter tonality. The new Deluxe has features that were inspired by those early models from the 1970s, with a non-weight relief mahogany body and bound maple top, a bound mahogany neck with a Rounded C profile, vintage-style Keystone tuners, Graph Tech® nut, and a traditional Les Paul control layout with 2 Volume and 2 Tone controls wired with Orange Drop® capacitors. Available in classic Goldtop and 70s Cherry Sunburst gloss nitrocellulose lacquer finishes.",
